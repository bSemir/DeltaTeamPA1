##
This is a "older brother" of ***Product Arena v1***.
- It allows users to sign up, log in, log out, select roles (Backend, Fullstack, Qa, Project Manager, Uiux), view their course content, learn and improve as a individual.
#
The frontend of the application is built with Flutter, while the backend is powered by AWS Amplify, DynamoDB, Lambda, Workmail, Cognito, S3, and SES.
#
# Getting Started

#
# AWS Services
The following AWS services are used in the backend of the application:

- AWS Amplify: used to manage the backend infrastructure and APIs.
- Amazon DynamoDB: used as the database for storing user data and course content.
- AWS Lambda: used to execute serverless functions for data processing and validation.
- Amazon WorkMail: used to send email notifications to users.
- Amazon Cognito: used for user authentication and authorization.
- Amazon S3: used to store course content, such as videos and images.
- Amazon SES: used for email sending.

To configure the AWS services, you will need to create an AWS account and set up the necessary IAM roles and permissions. You can use the AWS Amplify CLI to deploy the backend infrastructure and APIs.
